## To-Do
1) Turn the function definition into a proper expression atom (both parser and semantics level)
2) Thus introduce a new data type for function definitions. This type should not only hold the return type of the
   function, but also the types of the individual parameters.
3) On the semantic analysis level: Allow function definitions to be assigned to a variable. Prevent definitions
   from ever constituting a part of a binary expression. Ensure type compatibility in assignments, function calls, etc.
